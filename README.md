# ripgso
Verilog like HDL compiler to minimized NOR normal form. You can run the generated code on an elementary Turing-complete computing machine that performs one infinite loop, iteration after iteration. On each Nth iteration (every n operations), a ready-made set of output bits will appear and a new set of input bits can be entered.
